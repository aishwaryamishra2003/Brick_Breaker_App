# Brick Breaker Web Game

## Overview
Brick Breaker is a simple web-based arcade game where the player controls a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks. The game is developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to create an interactive and visually appealing experience.

## Why These Languages?
### **HTML (Structure)**
HTML provides the basic **structure** of the web page and defines the game canvas where elements are drawn.
- Creates the `<canvas>` element for game rendering.
- Links external JavaScript (`script.js`) for game logic.
- Defines a simple layout for responsiveness.

### **CSS (Styling)**
CSS enhances the **visual design** of the game by adding colors, positioning, and layout adjustments.
- Sets a **background color** for the game.
- Styles the canvas for better display.
- Improves user experience with simple UI effects.

### **JavaScript (Game Logic)**
JavaScript is the core **functional language** driving the game’s mechanics.
- **Draws** the ball, paddle, and bricks on the canvas.
- **Handles user input** (arrow keys to move the paddle).
- **Implements collision detection** for bricks, walls, and paddle.
- Runs the **game loop** to continuously update and animate gameplay.

## Features
- 🏓 **Paddle Movement**: Controlled with left/right arrow keys.
- ⚡ **Collision Detection**: Ball interacts with bricks and boundaries.
- 🎯 **Score System**: Points earned by breaking bricks.
